Gesture Recognition / Devnagiri

Devnagiri is an open source gesture recognition built on Java. It works on Gss and Knn algorithm to find the best match of the input provided by the user.

It has a gestures.xml file which contains a list of all the gestures that has been defined. The best thing about Devnagiri is that you can also add custom gestures to the list.

More detail about it soon. Till then Fork it, hack it, and if you think others would benefit, issue a pull request on this repo.
